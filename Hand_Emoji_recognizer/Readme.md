<h1>Hand Emoji Recognizer</h1>

## Description

Hand emoji recognizer detects the sign you made with your hand currrently it is trained with seven signs.
<p>
Like Thumbs up, Fist, Stop, Ok, Vulcan Salute ect.
<p>
I just started with deep learning so I thought it will be a great start. While making this I came across many difficulties like collecting and training the model BIG THANKS TO GOOGLE'S TEACHABLE MACHINE.
<p>
What it does is that a model is trained with all of the hand images and then is used, though the dataset was not so good. It crops the red box and then predict the sign. I am still learning object detection so I might make a second version of it. Once it predicts the sign the result frame will show the sign image.

## Technology used

I used python3 as a programming language.
<p>
For making this keras is used with tensorflow backend.
<p>
And for completing it with real time detection from camera I used opencv.
<p>
IDE that I use is pycharm.

Note:- Make sure you have latest version of tensorflow.
