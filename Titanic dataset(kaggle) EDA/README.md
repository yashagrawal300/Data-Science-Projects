<h2>Detail Description of project</h2>
<p>
<p>
<h4>I have taken this dataset from kaggle, I am using the file name "train.csv" which I have renamed it to "titanic.csv".
In this analysis. I have compared different features like "Sex", "Pclass", "Age" with survival. I used python libraries like-
<p>
<ol>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Seaborn</li>
</ol>
<p>
</h4>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
<p>
<h4>The conclusion that I found after doing analysis is that, females and children were given priority, workers and gaurds on that ship tried rescuing them first.<br>
Also, if we talk about Men on the ship, those who took the 1st class ticket have higher survival rate then other two classes.</h4>
